Retrieves the status of a transaction from the Payment Platform.
This request must be sent via HTTP POST (e.g., PHP cURL).

⚠️ Notes:
- When using cascading payments, a unique order_id is required per payment.
- GET_TRANS_STATUS with trans_id returns the status of a specific payment in the cascade.
- For the final status, rely on callbacks and enable 'Cascading Context for Get Status' in configuration.

Statuses returned: 3DS, REDIRECT, PENDING, PREPARE, DECLINED, SETTLED, REVERSAL, REFUND, VOID, CHARGEBACK.
